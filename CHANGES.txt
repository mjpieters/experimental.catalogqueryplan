Changelog
=========

3.0 - 2010-05-13
----------------

* Fixed tests to work with latest Zope 2.12 release.
  [hannosch]

3.0a3 - 2010-03-08
------------------

* Extended the stored queryplan format to optionally contain the value indexes
  set. This also makes it possible to manually influence the set.
  [hannosch]

* Changed intersection algorithm to avoid calculating the length of tree sets,
  as this would cause a scan of all their buckets. Intersections of sets with
  large tree sets are 10x faster while intersections of small sets and small
  tree sets are 50% slower.
  [hannosch, tesdal]

* Expanded performance tests to check against small tree sets.
  [hannosch]

3.0a2 - 2010-02-21
------------------

* Marked this package as a Plone plugin.
  [hannosch]

3.0a1 - 2010-02-21
------------------

* Updated to Cython 0.12.1.
  [hannosch]

* Reinstated request cache that was removed in 1.6. Catalog.getCounter() is
  part of the key.
  [tesdal]

* Use optimized intersection instead of unoptimized weightedIntersection
  if possible when joining result sets.
  [tesdal]

* Merged work from the querytree-cython branch. We have completely optional
  C optimizations based on Cython now.
  [hannosch]

* Moved the performance tests to the normal tests package and made them
  available on test level 2.
  [hannosch]

* Moved tests into a sub-package.
  [hannosch]

2.1 - 2009-11-19
----------------

* Moved patching into an initialize method and import ZopeTestCase in tests.
  This avoids import errors in Zope 2.12.
  [hannosch]

2.0 - 2009-11-10
----------------

* Add browser view named ``catalogqueryplan-prioritymap`` for convenient
  dumping of the current query plan as a Python module & support for loading
  it again using the `CATALOGQUERYPLAN` environment variable.
  [witsch]

1.9 - 2009-11-06
----------------

* Yet more fixes for the recent optimization. The ZCatalog API is too flexible.
  [hannosch]

1.8 - 2009-11-06
----------------

* Fixed an optimization introduced in the 1.7 release. We also need to look
  into the form arguments of a request to look for query restrictions.
  [hannosch]

1.7 - 2009-10-17
----------------

* When processing queries, do not ask indexes for their restrictions which
  aren't actually part of the query.
  [hannosch]

* Added a `DEFAULT_PRIORITYMAP` hook into the catalog module. This allows to
  provide a default priority map dictionary to initialize the prioritymap with
  a precomputed or manually designed one.
  [hannosch]

1.6 - 2009-09-10
----------------

* Removed the per request caching for the date range index. This can lead to
  invalid results for subsequent queries during the same request, if the data
  is changed.
  [hannosch]

1.5 - 2009-07-27
----------------

* Make sure to always include all indexes found in the original query into the
  queryplan. Otherwise if we get a query at first which happens to have no
  restrictions on a particular index, this index will no longer be queried at
  all. Now we at least preserve the index as part of the queryplan. The real
  solution is to continuously update the queryplan with result lengths as done
  in unimr.catalogqueryplan.
  [hannosch]

1.4 - 2009-05-20
----------------

* Added detailed per index time logging to the slow query reporting. You get
  the time spent per index in addition to the total now.
  [hannosch]

* Speed up the common KeywordIndexes like `portal_type` and
  `allowedRolesAndUsers`. Provided with a small passed in result set and an
  or-query we intersect it with each set in the index and union them later.
  Doing a straight multiunion on these types of indexes most often creates a
  set close to the total catalog size.
  [hannosch]

* Added optional logging of slow queries, inspired by unimr.catalogqueryplan.
  [hannosch]

* Added a mechanism to indicate the types of indexes, whose query values should
  be taken into account when building the prioritymap. An opt-in mechanism via
  VALUETYPES is provided much like ADVANCEDTYPES. Queries for example for
  `review_state` differ depending on the query for `pending` and `published`
  items, as those are usually very unevenly distributed.
  [hannosch]

1.3 - 2009-03-15
----------------

* Changed the log messages to debug level.
  [hannosch]

1.2 - 2009-03-03
----------------

* Don't use request.request as part of the update as it tends to
  trigger the browser id (_ZopeId)
  [tesdal]

* Make sure UnIndex always returns IISet, not int.
  [tesdal]

* Only sort intersection sets if there are more than 2 sets,
  otherwise the order is irrelevant
  [tesdal]

* Added logging for patches
  [swampmonkey]

1.1 - 2009-01-02
----------------

* Made the set monkeypatches temporary to avoid zc.relationship
  trying to persist the set methods.
  [tesdal]

1.0 - 2009-01-02
----------------

* Removed redundant intersections, added type checking to difference
  [tesdal]

* Add alternative weightedIntersection, and reuse BTree tests
  [tesdal]

* Don't monkeypatch intersection as zc.relationship will try
  to pickle the function.
  Added new ExtendedPathIndex code.
  [tesdal]

* Optimize UnIndex.apply_index internally, sort sets for AND,
  use multiunion for OR.
  [tesdal]

* Limit the number of if-statements in intersection,
  and added test for fastest way of finding max and min.
  [tesdal]

* Monkeypatch difference to handle big/tiny difference in Python
  This doesn't belong in queryplan, as it's only a BTree patch,
  and should be refactored out.
  [tesdal]

* Added performance tests.
  [tesdal]

* Fixed a bug with UnIndex return result missing index id
  [tesdal]

* Added tests for intersection, fixed a bug with empty second argument set
  [tesdal]

* Monkeypatch intersect to handle big/tiny intersects in Python
  [tesdal]

* Improved UnIndex query, to avoid redundant intersections
  [tesdal]

* Clarified LanguageIndex support. We are missing fallback support right now
  and now disable the optimization when fallback is enabled.
  [hannosch, mj]

0.9 - 2008-10-18
----------------

* Added support for LinguaPlone's LanguageIndex.
  [hannosch]

0.8 - 2008-09-03
----------------

* Let each index patch register itself with the ADVANCEDTYPES list.
  This should enable patching of other indexes as well, and remove
  the dependency on ExtendedPathIndex.
  [tesdal]

0.7 - 2008-08-22
----------------

* Check whether we're supposed to use daterangeindex
  at all before retrieving cached data.
  [tesdal]

0.6 - 2008-07-03
----------------

* Use a volatile instance variable to store the prioritymap.
  [mj]

0.5 - 2008/06/23
----------------

* DateRangeIndex shouldn't overwrite the semi-request passed into the 
  apply_index method.
  [mj]

0.4 - 2008/06/23
----------------

* DateRangeIndex now doesn't assume that REQUEST is available.
  [tesdal]

0.3
---

* Handle request being a dictionary.
  [tesdal]

0.3
---

* Refactored patches into multiple files.
  [tesdal]

* Dynamic query optimization based on result set analysis
  from queries against the same indexes.
  [tesdal]

* Manual query optimization based on typical usage pattern.
  [tesdal]

0.1
---

* Initial release
